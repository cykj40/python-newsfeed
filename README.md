## Technologies Used 
```md
Python: is an interpreted, high-level, open-source, general-purpose programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, 
and some functional programming constructs.

PIP: is the default package manager for Python. It is distributed with Python, which means that when you install Python, pip is 
automatically installed on your computer! 

SQLAlchemy: is the Python SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper that gives Python developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. 
It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, 
adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

PyMySQL: is a pure Python MySQL driver that connects a Python application to a MySQL database.

Bcrypt: is a PyPI library for Python that allows you to hash passwords. Hashing is the process of taking input and using a mathematical 
formula to chop and mix it up to produce an output of a specific length. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that it can easily 
convert input to a fixed-size output, but it is difficult to invert, or convert in the opposite direction. This attribute allows 
developers to secure passwords when authenticating users for their applications.

Python-DOTenv:  is a PyPI dotenv package used to manage environment variables inside Python's native virtual environment, or venv. 
This virtual environment is a self-contained directory that can maintain its own version of Python as well as its own library 
dependencies so that multiple Python projects can reside on the same machine without interfering with each other.

Gunicorn: or "Green Unicorn", is a Python HTTP Server for UNIX that is broadly compatible with various web frameworks (including Python 
and Flask), simply implemented, light on server resources, and fast.
